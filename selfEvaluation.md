# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
Not very confident.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I felt lost, I had to back up, calm down, take a break and come back to it later and then begin the slow process of trying to teach myself `for` statements.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
There are lots of ways to use `for` statements, I could use more practice with many of them, especially the more complex ones. Yes I will need to adjust my calendar and spend more time on it.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I can ask instructors and other students, I can try to figure it out by practicing and looking stuff up on mdn web docs.
